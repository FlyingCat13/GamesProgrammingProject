Play the game by using WASD and mouse to move around, E to interact/consume items, P to toggle pause/play.
The game has 6 rooms. You start in your bedroom. You need to get the trophy in the locked storage room and return to your room before your health is drained to 0.
Playthrough strategy can be found in the video, but it can be summerised like this

You need to go to the bathroom to interact with the toilet. The toilet will prompt the parents bedroom door to be unlocked and opened (simulating parents waking up to check). In there, you will find a stick that will help you get Dad's Office key hidden up high in Mom's Office. From there, unlock and open Dad's Office, take the key to storage room,
get the trophy and go back to your room, next to your bed. On the way, gather all the candies and matches that you can find and use them accordingly.
```
This strategy from assignment 1 still applies but with some changes: mom's office now opens by solving a binary panel, storage room now opens by activating a fused door trigger in dad's office instead of a key, the fuse is in the parents bedroom, guarded by a walker. The placement of the stick was slightly changed.

Items:
Match: halt health drain and stealth, can be used later
Candy: used immediately, halt health drain and heal half of max health.
Stick: extend reach range
Key: equip when opening a matched door to unlock it.
Fuse: activate the fused door trigger
Trophy: win condition item
