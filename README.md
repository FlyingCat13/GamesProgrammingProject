You need to go to the bathroom to interact with the toilet. The toilet will prompt the parents bedroom door to be unlocked and opened (simulating parents waking up to check). In there, you will find a stick that will help you get Dad's Office key hidden up high in Mom's Office. From there, unlock and open Dad's Office, take the key to storage room,
get the trophy and go back to your room, next to your bed. On the way, gather all the candies and matches that you can find and use them accordingly.

Items:
Match: halt health drain, can be used later
Candy: used immediately, halt health drain and heal half of max health.
Stick: extend reach range
Key: equip when opening a matched door to unlock it.
Trophy: win condition item
